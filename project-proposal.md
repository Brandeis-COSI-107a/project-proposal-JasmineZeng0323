# Practical Application of Cybersecurity:
## Phishing Website Investigation Using Kali Linux

## 1. Introduction:

In the current digital landscape, phishing attacks have evolved into highly sophisticated threats, posing substantial risks to individuals, especially the older generation who may be more susceptible. Recognizing the severity of these issues, this project aims to proactively address the rising tide of phishing scams through an immersive and hands-on educational experience. By leveraging the powerful tools available in Kali Linux, I will not only learn to create a phishing website, but, more importantly, gain the skills to defend against such attacks through this experience.
