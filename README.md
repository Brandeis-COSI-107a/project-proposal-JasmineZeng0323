# Practical Application of Cybersecurity: Phishing Website Investigation Using Kali Linux

## Introduction:

My name is Ziming Zeng. In the rapidly evolving digital environment, phishing attacks have become a sophisticated threat, particularly affecting vulnerable populations such as the older generation. Therefore, I am embarking on a project to create a phishing website. This endeavor is not only about learning how to create a phishing website, but more importantly, it is about equipping participants with the skills to defend themselves against such attacks.

## Project Objectives:

- **Learning by Doing:**
  - Gain hands-on experience in creating a phishing website.

- **Understanding Vulnerabilities:**
  - Explore the pitfalls of being gullible and understand the psychology behind falling victim to phishing scams.

- **Combatting Phishing Risks:**
  - Develop skills to defend against escalating risks of phishing attacks.

## Methodology:

I will be using Kali Linux, a powerful cybersecurity tool, to delve into the creation of a phishing website. Through this practical project, I aim to learn not only the technical aspects of creating such a site but also the critical thinking and defensive strategies necessary to counteract phishing threats.

## Expected Outcomes:

Upon completion of this project, I anticipate:
- Acquiring practical skills in creating a phishing website.
- Gaining insights into the psychology of phishing victims.
- Developing a robust understanding of defensive strategies against phishing attacks.

This project is a proactive step towards enhancing cybersecurity awareness and preparedness, especially in the face of evolving digital threats.
